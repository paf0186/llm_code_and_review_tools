"""Gerrit patch series DAG visualizer.

Builds a full DAG of all related changes for a Gerrit patch, resolving
stale patchset dependencies to show which patches need rebasing. Generates
an interactive HTML visualization with:

- Vertical tree layout growing upward from the anchor change
- Edge labels showing which patchset each dependency goes through
- Stale edges highlighted (child depends on old patchset of parent)
- Click a node to see its review state and chains of dependents/ancestors
- Filter controls for abandoned changes and historical-parent edges
- Separate-series trees for topic/hashtag-matching patches

The key insight: Gerrit's /related endpoint shows one patchset per change
in the commit chain. When a change is rebased, its old patchset's children
become "orphans" — their parent commit no longer matches anything in the
current chain. By fetching ALL_REVISIONS for each change, we can reconnect
these orphans to the correct parent change at the correct (stale) patchset.
